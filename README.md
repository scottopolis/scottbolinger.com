# Gatsby Publisher Theme

A Gatsby theme for publishing a static headless site with WordPress.

- Exports fully static HTML files so your site is lightning fast
- Updates when you publish a new post
- Tailwind CSS
- GraphQL

[Demo site](https://scottbolinger.com/)

## Summary

Tailwindcss and postcss are required to have tailwind properly working, emotion is installed because it is very common to use a CSS in JS framework and I think it is useful to have emotion and tailwind installed and configured to work together.

## Installation

```sh
yarn
```
